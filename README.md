<summary><strong>Traffic Lights</strong></summary>

Traffic Lights are based on the direction of the player placing them. They can be toggled by redstone.

Automatic Traffic Lights are also based on the player direction. Their speed can be changed by feeding them sugar or fermented spider eyes. Each click adds or subtracts 20% of the current speed, for a total of nine speed combinations.
Giving an Automatic Traffic Light a redstone signal will freeze it in place.

<summary><strong>Known Issues</strong></summary>
  
- The Highway Barrier texture has some Z-fighting if connected to both the X and Z axis.
- Pallets have no drops, I am unable to get the loottable to accept multiple blockstates (PR's welcome!)
- Asphalt is creative-only for now. I haven't decided what recipe to give it yet.
